# Wrong syncronization of folders: 

The problem was not concurrency, but the wrong and crazy sintax:
```ts
arr[-1 + 1]
```
Fortunately, this was solved quickly. 

# Database empty:

When the application was starting, an error it was triggered, because of empty 
database. The problem was the absence of correct importantion at `index.ts`.

The solution: 
```ts
import './database/migrations/migrations';
```

# Null returning from getDirname.ts

The function `getDirname` was returning `null`. The problem was the syncronization
between the loop of new files with the `array` of `paths`.

For example: if I have two folders and five files, only two folders was used, and the 
third `type` of file was `null`. In summary, it was a wrong interation on array of `paths`.

This was fixed, but require improvement. The solution:
```ts
   query.run({
      name: path.parse(file).name,
      content: buffer,
      type: path.basename(path.dirname(path.join(basePath, file))),
      // before:
      type: getDirname(file)[idx]
    });
```
